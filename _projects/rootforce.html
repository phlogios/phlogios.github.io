A third-person multiplayer team deathmatch game for 10 players. The game was written "from scratch", with its own engine, in 6 months. The team size was 9 programmers and 2 technical artists. My contributions to the game were: Rendering (mainly lighting and shadow tech), engine architecture, gameplay scripting in Lua.
